								Stratis 2.3.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Stratis 2.3.0 adds additional flexibility to its encryption support via
<a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis">Clevis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stratis-2-3-0">stratis 2.3.0</h2>
<p>This release extends the <code>pool unlock</code> command, and adds two new commands,
<code>pool bind</code> and <code>pool unbind</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>pool bind</code> command establishes an alternative mechanism for unlocking
a pool. The user may select either the &quot;tang&quot; mechanism, which implements
NBDE (Network-bound Disc Encryption) by means of a Tang server, or the
&quot;tpm2&quot; mechanism, which uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) encryption.
Binding the devices in a pool to a supplementary Clevis encryption policy does
not remove the primary encryption mechanism, which uses a key in the kernel
keyring.</p>
<p>The <code>pool unbind</code> command simply unbinds a previously added encryption
policy from all the devices in the specified pool.</p>
<p>In the <code>pool unlock</code> command it is now necessary to specify the mechanism.
Use <code>clevis</code> to make use of the Clevis unlocking policy previously
specified for the devices in the pool. Use <code>keyring</code>, to make use of the
mechanism that uses a key in the kernel keyring, which was introduced
in Stratis 2.1.0. Note that the <code>pool unlock</code> command unlocks all currently
locked pools.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-3-0">stratisd 2.3.0</h2>
<p>This release introduces two D-Bus interface revisions, which differ in the
following way from the previous revisions.</p>
<p><code>org.storage.stratis2.Manager.r3</code> modifies the <code>UnlockPool</code> method to take
an additional parameter, <code>unlock_method</code>, which may be <code>keyring</code> or <code>clevis</code>.</p>
<p><code>org.storage.stratis2.pool.r3</code> adds two new method: <code>Bind</code> and <code>Unbind</code>.
The <code>Bind</code> method takes two arguments, <code>pin</code> and <code>json</code>. The <code>pin</code> argument
designates the Clevis pin as a string, and the <code>json</code> argument encodes
a Clevis configuration appropriate to the designated pin. The configuration
is a JSON object. Besides Clevis information, it may include Stratis-specific
keys that encode configuration decisions that Stratis may implement. At
present there is just one such key: <code>stratis:tang:trust_url</code>.
The <code>Unbind</code> method reverses a <code>Bind</code> action.</p>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <code>Bind</code> method may be called with any Clevis pin and configuration;
we expect that any valid Clevis pin and configuration can be used to bind the
devices in a pool. However the Stratis project officially supports only the
&quot;tang&quot; and &quot;tpm2&quot; pins as those are the pins that may be designated via
<code>stratis</code>. Support for additional Clevis policies may be introduced into
<code>stratis</code> in later releases.</p>
<p>When binding a supplementary encryption policy to the devices in a pool
using Clevis, the primary key, which is the key in the kernel keyring which
was originally used to encrypt each device, must be supplied. stratisd
obtains the appropriate key from the kernel keyring in order to provide it
to the Clevis binding mechanism. The correct key must be present in the
keyring for the bind operation to succeed. It is not necessary for the user
to specify the key, stratisd obtains the necessary information from the
LUKS2 metadata on the devices in the pool.</p>
<p>In general, it is unwise to write a key consisting of arbitrary binary data
to a keyfile. An accidental newline character in the data may cause the
contents of the file to be truncated at the newline when read in one context
while all the data may be read from the file in some other context.</p>
<p>We are not aware that such a mistake would result in any error in Stratis's
operation when Stratis is used in the way that we recommend. We explicitly
acknowledge that it might be possible, through some direct interaction with
the stratisd D-Bus API, or by, e.g., setting a key in the kernel keyring
without using stratis, to manufacture a situation where stratisd could not
bind the devices in a pool, even when the correct key is set in the kernel
keyring. We would not treat such a situation as evidence of a bug in Stratis.</p>

								Stratis 2.2.1 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Stratis 2.2.1 is a bug fix release. It fixes the following bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was possible to cause stratisd to hang by leaving open a D-Bus
connection when setting a key in the kernel keyring.</li>
<li>stratis would pass as arguments on the D-Bus and stratisd would accept
relative, rather than absolute, path names to specify devices.</li>
<li>Pool and filesystem names that included characters that would be escaped
by udev when constructing filesystem symlinks were permitted.</li>
<li>The man page entry for the <code>key list</code> command was missing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other general improvements were made, and several crate version requirements
were increased.</p>

								Stratis 2.2.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Stratis 2.2.0 now places Stratis filesystem symlinks in <code>/dev/stratis</code>,
rather than <code>/stratis</code>. Stratis creates and maintains the symlinks by means
of udev rules, rather than directly via stratisd as previously.
The <code>/stratis</code> directory is neither created nor used by stratisd 2.2.0.</p>
<p>This release places management of the terminal setting for interactive
encryption-key entry in stratisd rather than in stratis-cli.</p>
<p>This release also includes enhancements to the stratisd D-Bus interface,
various bug fixes, and a change in the stratisd CLI specification for
log levels.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-2-0">stratisd 2.2.0</h2>
<p>This release creates and maintains Stratis filesystem symlinks in
<code>/dev/stratis</code> by means of udev rules. It includes a small Rust script,
<code>stratis_uuids_to_names</code> which is invoked by the Stratis udev rule which
sets the Stratis filesystem symlinks.</p>
<p>In the case where stratisd is updated in place, some filesystem symlinks
may remain in <code>/stratis</code>. This release includes a shell script,
<code>stratis_migrate_symlinks.sh</code> which may be used to clean up the <code>/stratis</code>
directory and ensure that the correct symlinks exist in <code>/dev/stratis</code>. The
script removes the <code>/stratis</code> directory once it has completed without error.
The shell script relies on a small Rust script, <code>stratis_dbusquery_version</code>
which is included with this version of stratisd.</p>
<p>This release also extends the D-Bus interface in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It sends <code>org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.InterfacesAdded</code>and
<code>org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.InterfacesRemoved</code> signals on the
D-Bus whenever a D-Bus object is added to or removed from the D-Bus
interface.</li>
<li>It adds a new D-Bus property, <code>PhysicalPath</code>, for the 
<code>org.storage.stratis2.blockdev.r2</code> interface. This property is
principally useful for encrypted Stratis block devices; it identifies
the block device on which the Stratis LUKS2 metadata resides.</li>
<li>It adds a new key, <code>LockedPools</code>, to the
<code>org.storage.stratis2.FetchProperties.r2</code> interface for objects that
implement the <code>org.storage.stratis2.Manager</code> interface. This key
returns a D-Bus object that maps the UUIDs of locked pools to their
corresponding key descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>

								Stratis 2.1.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Stratis 2.1.0 introduces support for encryption.</p>
<p>It supports per-pool encryption of the devices that form a pool's data
tier. A pool may be encrypted, or its constituent encrypted devices may
be activated, by means of a key stored in the kernel keyring.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-1-0">stratisd 2.1.0</h2>
<p>This release implements encryption support and adds several new D-Bus
interfaces to administer or monitor that support.</p>
<p>It implements encryption support in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single instance of stratisd can support both encrypted and unencrypted
pools.</li>
<li>The choice to encrypt a pool must be made at the time a pool is created.</li>
<li>At present, the use of a cache and of encryption are mutually exclusive;
if the pool is created with encryption enabled, then it is not possible
to create a cache.</li>
<li>Each pool may be encrypted by means of a key in the kernel keyring; each
encrypted pool may make use of a different key, but all devices in a pool
are encrypted with a single key.</li>
<li>Any additional devices that are added to an encrypted pool's data tier
will be encrypted using the key that was specified when the pool was
initialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>stratisd 2.1.0 supplies several new D-Bus interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.manager.r1</code>: This interface supplies an
extended <code>CreatePool</code> method, to support an optional argument for
encryption. In addition, it supplies a number of method for key
management.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.pool.r1</code>: This interface supports explicit
initialization of a cache tier. Previously, a cache was initialized as
a side-effect of the addition of the first device to the cache tier.
It also supports the new <code>Encrypted</code> property.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.FetchProperties.r1</code>: This interface supports an
additional <code>HasCache</code> property.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.Report.r1</code>: This interface supports a set of
ad-hoc reports about Stratis. The interface is unstable; the names by
which the reports can be accesed are not guaranteed to remain stable,
and the format of any report is only guaranteed to be valid JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>
<p>The following are significant implementation details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each block device in an encrypted pool's data tier is encrypted with a
distinct, randomly chosen MEK (Media Encryption Key) on initialization.</li>
<li>All devices belonging to a single encrypted pool share a single passphrase,
supplied via the kernel keyring.</li>
<li>The release requires cryptsetup version 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to thank our external contributor GuillaumeGomez for further
work on metadata refactoring (<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1573">stratisd issue 1573</a>).</p>
<h2 id="stratis-cli-2-1-0">stratis-cli 2.1.0</h2>
<p>This release requires stratisd 2.1.0. The user will observe the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>pool create</code> command has been extended to allow encryption.</li>
<li>There is a new <code>pool init_cache</code> command, for initializing a cache.</li>
<li>There is a new subcommand, <code>key</code>, for key management tasks.</li>
<li>There is a new subcommand, <code>report</code>, which allows the display of certain
reports generated by stratisd.</li>
<li>The output of <code>pool list</code> now includes a <code>Properties</code> column; each
entry in the column is a string encoding the following properties of the
pool:
<ul>
<li>whether or not it has a cache</li>
<li>whether or not it is encrypted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All commands now verify that stratis is communicating with a compatible
version of stratisd and will fail with an appropriate error if stratisd is
found to have an incompatible version.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To create an encrypted pool, a user must first ensure that a key is placed
in the kernel keyring. We strongly encourage using the commands available
via the stratis <code>key</code> subcommand for this task. This key, which is secret,
has a corresponding key description, which is public.</p>
<p>An encrypted pool is then created by specifying the key description
when using the <code>pool create</code> command.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the correct key and corresponding key description be set
in the kernel keyring in order to set up a previously encrypted pool. Setting
up a previously encrypted pool requires an explicit <code>pool unlock</code> command from
the user. This command will attempt to unlock the devices belonging to any
previously encrypted pool; it can only unlock all devices if a key for every
encrypted pool is in the keyring. Once the devices belonging to a previously
encrypted pool have been unlocked, the pool will be set up, and can be used in
exactly the same manner as an unencrypted pool.</p>

								Cryptsetup Rust bindings release
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Monday January 13, 2020</p>
<p>One major focus in the Stratis project recently has been adding an encryption layer
for data in Stratis pools. Cryptsetup provides a library backend for programmatically
setting up device encryption, so we decided to write Rust bindings to access the
existing Cryptsetup functionality in Rust.</p>
<p>While designing the bindings, we took every opportunity to make use of Rust's
type system, leveraging features like reference lifetimes and type parameters
to ensure that as much of our public API as possible can be validated by the
compiler.</p>
<p>Though these bindings were designed with Stratis in mind, it is intended
to be general-purpose and so we encourage others to try it out. The license
is MPLv2, but it becomes effectively GPL when linked with libcryptsetup.
As a result, any project using our bindings will also need to be GPL or
GPL-compatible.</p>

								Stratis 2.0.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday November 6, 2019</p>
<p>Stratis 2.0 is a significant update for both the daemon and the CLI. The
changes to the daemon are covered first, followed by the changes to the
CLI.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-0-0">stratisd 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release makes the D-Bus API more robust, reliable, predictable, and
extensible. There are several significant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The set of D-Bus properties has been reduced to a core set of fundamental
and stable properties. Other filesystem, pool, or block devices properties are
now obtainable via methods in the <code>FetchProperties</code> interface. This change
increases the robustness of the D-Bus interface to failures occurring in any
particular pool, filesystem, or block device, and decreases the computational
cost of most operations requested by the Stratis CLI. Several properties,
formerly returned as D-Bus properties, are now unavailable by means of the
D-Bus. In every case, the reason for removing the property was that it did not
represent a well-defined value. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus method calls are idempotent. This should make writing scripts
using the D-Bus API much simpler and make reasoning about the behavior
of the engine more straightforward. Henceforth, we will treat as a bug any
non-idempotent behavior in the D-Bus API. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus size values are now returned in bytes. Again, this should make
writing scripts against the D-Bus more straightforward, since it will be
unnecessary for the script writer to change their interpretation of the number
returned on the D-Bus depending on the value that it represents. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1243">stratisd issue 1243</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements to the D-Bus API will be implemented by means of
additional versioned interfaces.</p>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>
<h2 id="stratis-cli-2-0-0">stratis-cli 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release requires stratisd 2.0.0. The user will observe the following
significant improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CLI is significantly more robust. Previously, there was a category of
error conditions in pools, filesystems, and block devices that would make the
CLI virtually unusable; this problem has now been entirely resolved. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLI now reports errors consistently in conditions where a human user
would generally expect an error to be reported. Previously, many commands in
the CLI were idempotent, to facilitate scripting. Now there is a clear
distinction between the CLI behavior and the stratisd D-Bus API behavior: the
CLI behavior is designed strictly according to the expectations of a human
user, the stratisd D-Bus API is the programmable interface. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, anyone wishing to implement a program that uses Stratis for
storage management is strongly advised to make use of the stratisd D-Bus API
rather than the CLI.</p>

								stratis-cli 1.1.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday October 2, 2019</p>
<p>With this release stratis now recognizes an environment variable,
<code>STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT</code>. This environment variable controls the timeout for
any individual D-Bus call that stratis makes. You may want to set it to a
higher value than the default, which is 120 seconds, if you are running
tests or otherwise scripting via stratis, and wish to avoid erroneous errors
resulting from slow operations in your testing environment. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/252">stratis-cli issue 252</a> for further details.</p>
<p>This release also introduces simplified and more complete error-reporting.
For stratis, it constitutes an error if any command issued results in a
Python stack trace. If you experience any such incident, please
report it in a GitHub issue, including the full stack trace, and
circumstances that led up to the incident.</p>

							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday October 2, 2019</p>
<p>This release includes one significant bug fix and a substantial refactoring.</p>
<p>The bug was caused by an inconsistency in the metadata handling which led to
a failure to properly update the Stratis metadata if stratisd was restarted
in an environment where the system clock indicated a time earlier than when
it had previously been running. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1509">stratisd issue 1509</a> for further
details.</p>
